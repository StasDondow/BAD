# BAD

It is necessary to develop an algorithm for the following program:
- the program accepts an arbitrary text as input and finds in each word of this text the very first symbol that is NOT repeated in the analyzed word
- further, from the received set of symbols, the program must choose the first unique one (that is, the one that is no longer found in the set and return it)
